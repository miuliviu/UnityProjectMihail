# UnityProjectMihail
We will save all the builds here Mihail!

First things to do are:

1. We will create a Git Account, Setup SourceTree(A windows git repo IDE), download the project using SourceTree and open it in Unity 3D 
2. We will learn how to handle the Unity 3D IDE. Walk through menus, tabs and different basic actions 
3. We will learn how to add and remove objects to a scene
4  We will learn how to write and add a script to different objects

After we end these tasks, we will go further into learning how to handle more advanced stuff such as effect particles and many others. 

Please tell me when you want to start working.

Best Regards,
Liviu. :3
